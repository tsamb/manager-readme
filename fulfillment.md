## On fulfillment

### Maslow's hierarchy of needs

I like [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) as a model to apply in the workplace. As an absolute baseline, the workplace must provide physiological and safety needs. If not, these are the top order of priority. It is also important that leaders and members within an organization set the culture such that everyone feels a sense of social belonging.

Given the foundation of physiological, safety and belonging needs, I see a big part of my job as your manager as helping you fulfill your esteem and self-actualization needs: both self-esteem and respect from your peers, and you realizing your goals and potential.

### Fulfillment through accomplishment

Intrinsic motivation comes from people finding meaning in their work. People find joy, meaning and fulfillment from the act of accomplishment. This could mean shipping a product, releasing a feature, or even getting a test to pass. Buying-in to and believing in the product ("this is going to make the world a better place" or "this is going to surprise and delight our users") or end goal ("this is going to make me a better developer" or "this is going to leave our codebase in a better state than when I started") amplifies the effect. 

### Fulfillment through growth

People also find joy, meaning and fulfillment from personal growth. Growth can be as small as learning a new, more efficient keyboard shortcut or keybinding, or as large as evolving your approach to system design.
