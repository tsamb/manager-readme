# Me!

### My tech / software background

 In the mid to late 90s, I hacked around with "90s JavaScript", ActionScript and HyperTalk (on Mac OSes pre OSX). This is the appropriate place for a shout out to Gopher servers and GeoCities websites. In the early 2000s, I started building websites and other software projects for small businesses.

 Academically, I majored in [logic and computation](http://www.science.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/subjects-and-specialisations/ug-majors/logic-and-computation-ug.html) (and philosophy) in undergrad. This is where I was first introduced to compsci fundamentals and learnt Java. I later completed a law degree in which I wrote my [dissertation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2286403) on international digital copyright infringement — specifically, which countries' laws apply to file sharing when said files are available in any country with access to the internet. I also have [speech and drama](https://www.speechnz.co.nz/) teaching credentials.

 Professionally, I have:
 * started two failed software startups;
 * taught logic and critical thinking at the University of Auckland;
 * worked as a lawyer at a large commercial firm;
 * taught full stack web development at a coding bootcamp;
 * led software teams at a real estate startup;
 * worked as an indpendent software consultant and led consulting teams.

### My personal interests

 I am a lifelong autodidactic craftsperson. I find joy in creativity and craft (I consider software a craft). Other than dabbling in [new languages](https://github.com/tsamb/haskell-game-of-life) or frameworks, you might also find me woodworking, renovating, gardening, bicycle tuning, beading, macraméing, knitting, script writing or acting.

 I have a nostalgic soft spot for 1990s video games; this is particularly true for 16-bit graphics and soundtracks (_Chrono Trigger_ :heart_eyes:), but also 90s PC and Mac titles (_Willy Beamish_, _The Incredible Machine_, _Sim City 2000_ :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:).

 I fell in love with cycling after living in Copenhagen for six months. I'm a huge advocate for improving cycling infrastructure in New York City (in fact, in any urban area). Cycling as a mode of transit around the city is already awesome, but it could be even safer and more efficient.
