# Sam's manager README
A readme on my management philosophies

## What is this?
This document is an introduction to me and an overview of my philosophies on managing people. This document, like my philosophies and practices are subject to change and _growth_. In fact, I would be disappointed in myself if my views did not change and grow as I receive feedback, recognize patterns and try new things.

## About Me
I have been coding in some form or another for 20+ years (insert throwbacks here to 90s JavaScript, ActionScript and HyperTalk; here's also the appropriate place for a shout out to Gopher servers and GeoCities websites). I have been working with software engineers — pairing, thought-partnering, managing — in some capacity or another since 2008.

Academically, I majored in [logic and computation](http://www.science.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/subjects-and-specialisations/ug-majors/logic-and-computation-ug.html) (and philosophy) in undergrad. I later completed a law degree in which I wrote my [dissertation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2286403) on international digital copyright infringement. I also have [speech and drama](https://www.speechnz.co.nz/) teaching credentials.

Professionally, I have:
* started two failed software startups;
* taught logic and critical thinking at the University of Auckland;
* worked as a lawyer at a large commercial firm;
* taught full stack web development at a coding bootcamp;
* led software teams at a real estate startup.

## Personal

I have an incredibly nostalgic soft spot for 1990s video games; this is particularly true for 16-bit graphics and soundtracks (Chrono Trigger :heart_eyes:), but also 90s PC and Mac titles.

I am a lifelong autodidactic craftsperson. I find joy in creativity and craft (I consider software a craft). Other than dabbling in new languages or frameworks, you might also find me woodworking, renovating, gardening, bicycle tuning, beading, macraméing, knitting, script writing or acting.


Personal Principles / Values — What are your default assumptions about people and their intentions? What mindsets do you have and which do you hope other people adopt when working together on the team? What things trigger you?
One-on-Ones — What style of 1:1s do you want out of your team? Most above follow the weekly/bi-weekly, 30 min cadence, and the employee controls the agenda.
Feedback (how to give & how you give) — What type of feedback do you want? Are you comfortable with people being blunt with you? How do you prefer to give feedback? How do you expect your team to react to feedback?
How to interpret my calendar — Sometimes a manager’s calendar can be packed. Almost every manager above wants their team to know that they are the most important part of their job, so they’re explicit in saying so. Message them on slack if you need to talk. They’ll make time.
