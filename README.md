# Sam's manager README
A readme on my management philosophies

## What is this?
This document is an introduction to me and an overview of my philosophies on managing people. This document, like my philosophies and practices are subject to change and _growth_. In fact, I would be disappointed in myself if my views did not change and grow as I receive feedback, recognize patterns and try new things.

## About Me

### Background
I have been coding in some form or another for 20+ years (insert throwbacks here to 90s JavaScript, ActionScript and HyperTalk; here's also the appropriate place for a shout out to Gopher servers and GeoCities websites). I have been working with software engineers — pairing, thought-partnering, managing — in some capacity or another since 2008.

Academically, I majored in [logic and computation](http://www.science.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/subjects-and-specialisations/ug-majors/logic-and-computation-ug.html) (and philosophy) in undergrad. I later completed a law degree in which I wrote my [dissertation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2286403) on international digital copyright infringement. I also have [speech and drama](https://www.speechnz.co.nz/) teaching credentials.

Professionally, I have:
* started two failed software startups;
* taught logic and critical thinking at the University of Auckland;
* worked as a lawyer at a large commercial firm;
* taught full stack web development at a coding bootcamp;
* led software teams at a real estate startup.

### Other personal interests

I am a lifelong autodidactic craftsperson. I find joy in creativity and craft (I consider software a craft). Other than dabbling in new languages or frameworks, you might also find me woodworking, renovating, gardening, bicycle tuning, beading, macraméing, knitting, script writing or acting.

I have a nostalgic soft spot for 1990s video games; this is particularly true for 16-bit graphics and soundtracks (_Chrono Trigger_ :heart_eyes:), but also 90s PC and Mac titles (_Willy Beamish_, _The Incredible Machine_, _Sim City 2000_ :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:).

I fell in love with cycling after living in Copenhagen for six months. I'm a huge advocate for improving cycling infrastructure in New York City (in fact, in any urban area). Cycling as a mode of transit the city is already awesome, but it could be even safer and more efficient.

## On engineering management

I believe that users matter. I believe that bottom lines matter, be those bottoms lines net income or some [non-conventional measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line). However, _**I believe that the people and teams building the product matter most.**_

I believe that focusing on **people** and helping them find **meaning** and **fulfillment** in their work promotes business success. That is, happy and fulfilled workers performing meaningful work play an incredibly large part in happy users and healthy bottom lines.

My job as your manager is to help you define success and then actualize it.

### Ownership and autonomy

I value you having ownership of and autonomy over your work. It's my job to thought partner with you and provide you with feedback. It's your job to do your job (and not have me _telling_ you how to do your job).

### Fulfillment and self-actualization

I believe that employees' personal fulfillment and self actualization leads to business success. Learning, growth and feedback is a key part of this. This is one of the reasons why I value intellectual curiosity is an important trait. Intellectual curiosity intrinsically motivates people to learn, grow and realize their potential.

### Empathy between engineers, product and business stakeholders

It's easy for software engineers to get frustrated with pressure coming from product managers and business stakeholders ("this features needs to be delivered **_yesterday_!**"). It's easy for product managers and business stakeholders to get frustrated by pushback from software engineers ("it's not as easy as '_just putting a new button there_'...").

Building empathy between these stakeholders helps them understand each other's roles, pressures, frustrations and constraints.

## On feedback

[Several](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LGL7fh5zWx8XqHRBra51LcMIHCUluqrdXZ_-XBTXqlg/edit#slide=id.g2703004c10_0_232) of [these](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/edit#slide=id.g2cf5bbf228_0_280) other [manager READMEs](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) mention safety, effort and benefit as pillars of good feedback ([Matt Newkirk](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/), in particular, says "neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback"). I absolutely agree that feedback should always be delivered within a safe space and I agree feedback should always be for the benefit and growth of the other person. However, I don't agree that feedback needs to be "low effort". **Feedback can be hard to give and receive.** But it is well worth the effort. I think it is perfectly natural for a receiver of feedback to feel defensive (particularly initially) in some cases.

My framework for feedback is as follows:
1. Build inter-team and inter-personal **trust** alongside a culture of feedback.
1. Train people to **ask for feedback** and be open and vulnerable to that feedback for their own benefit and growth.
1. Only ever give feedback for the genuine benefit and growth of the recipient (**kindness**).
1. Give feedback that the recipient can act on (**specific** and **actionable**).
1. Recommend that people take time and space to digest and **reflect** on feedback. Reflect seriously, honestly and vulnerably on feedback, with a **growth mindset**.
1. Given genuine reflection, **self-parse the useful feedback** from the rest. Be slow to dismiss feedback about which you feel defensive. This often provides the biggest avenue for growth.
1. Work actively to **integrate the useful feedback** into your daily life and habits. (That is, grow!)

I think that my feedback philosophies go hand in hand with my views on the importance of intellectual curiosity, growth mindset and clear communication of goals. Feedback also dovetails with my philosophy that a large part of my job as manager is to help the people I am managing reach self-actualization.

I credit the honing of my feedback philosophies to my time working and teaching at Dev Bootcamp. In a recent conversation with [Jon Stowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonstowe/), we both agreed that "actionable, specific and kind feedback" was a takeaway from DBC that we continue to apply in work and life.

## On learning and growth

Importance. Maslow's hierarchy. Bloom's taxonomy. Journey towards self-actualization.

### Experiential learning

### Growth mindset

### Reflection


## Things I haven't worked out yet

### How to balance software implementation with other work

### How to pay down conceptual, technical and product debt

Personal Principles / Values — What are your default assumptions about people and their intentions? What mindsets do you have and which do you hope other people adopt when working together on the team? What things trigger you?
One-on-Ones — What style of 1:1s do you want out of your team? Most above follow the weekly/bi-weekly, 30 min cadence, and the employee controls the agenda.
Feedback (how to give & how you give) — What type of feedback do you want? Are you comfortable with people being blunt with you? How do you prefer to give feedback? How do you expect your team to react to feedback?
How to interpret my calendar — Sometimes a manager’s calendar can be packed. Almost every manager above wants their team to know that they are the most important part of their job, so they’re explicit in saying so. Message them on slack if you need to talk. They’ll make time.
